Q: how uniform are multi-choice widgets?
How many of our multi-choice just have a single "blockMath" inside of each item?

TODO
I need a way to describe the "shape" of a perseus markdown data structure.
- for paragraphs, type== & content.every(...)
- for widgets, widgetType== & maybe make sure the contents of the widgets
  match? I'll maybe add that later.
- for everything else, type is enough? probably. unless there are other things
